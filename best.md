In a REST service built using Java Spring Boot, exception handling is typically distributed across different layers of the application. The key is to throw and catch exceptions in a way that aligns with the responsibilities of each layer. Here's how you can approach exception handling at different layers:

### 1. **Controller Layer**

- **Throw Exceptions:** Controllers should primarily catch exceptions that are directly related to HTTP requests, such as validation errors or missing parameters. However, they should not contain complex business logic, so they should not be the primary source of exceptions related to business rules.

- **Catch Exceptions:** Controllers should catch exceptions that are specific to request handling, like `HttpMessageNotReadableException` or `MethodArgumentNotValidException`, and translate them into meaningful HTTP responses.

    ```java
    @PostMapping("/users")
    public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@Valid @RequestBody User user, BindingResult result) {
        if (result.hasErrors()) {
            throw new BadRequestException("Invalid user data");
        }
        // Delegate to service layer
    }
    ```

### 2. **Service Layer**

- **Throw Exceptions:** The service layer is where business logic resides. Here, you should throw custom exceptions (e.g., `ResourceNotFoundException`, `BusinessException`) that represent specific error conditions related to the business rules. These exceptions should be thrown when a business rule is violated or when a resource is not found.

    ```java
    public User findUserById(Long id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException("User not found"));
    }
    ```

- **Catch Exceptions:** Generally, the service layer should not catch exceptions unless you need to perform some compensation logic or transform the exception into another type of custom exception.

### 3. **Repository Layer**

- **Throw Exceptions:** The repository layer interacts with the database. If there's a problem with database operations, such as a `DataIntegrityViolationException` or `EntityNotFoundException`, these exceptions should be allowed to propagate up to the service layer, where they can be handled or wrapped in a business exception.

    ```java
    public User saveUser(User user) {
        try {
            return userRepository.save(user);
        } catch (DataIntegrityViolationException e) {
            throw new BusinessException("Duplicate user email");
        }
    }
    ```

- **Catch Exceptions:** The repository layer generally should not catch exceptions unless it needs to convert them into more specific or meaningful exceptions that can be understood by the service layer.

### 4. **Global Exception Handling (Cross-cutting Concern)**

- **Handle Exceptions:** Use `@ControllerAdvice` or a `@RestControllerAdvice` to handle exceptions globally. This layer will catch exceptions thrown from the controller and service layers and map them to appropriate HTTP responses.

    ```java
    @RestControllerAdvice
    public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
    
        @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
        public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleResourceNotFoundException(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
            ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(
                HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND.value(),
                ex.getMessage(),
                System.currentTimeMillis()
            );
            return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
        }

        @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
        public ResponseEntity<ErrorResponse> handleGeneralException(Exception ex) {
            ErrorResponse errorResponse = new ErrorResponse(
                HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR.value(),
                "An unexpected error occurred",
                System.currentTimeMillis()
            );
            return new ResponseEntity<>(errorResponse, HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR);
        }
    }
    ```

### Summary

- **Controller Layer:** Catch and handle exceptions related to HTTP requests. Avoid complex business logic here.
- **Service Layer:** Throw business-specific exceptions and propagate other exceptions up the stack.
- **Repository Layer:** Allow data-related exceptions to propagate or wrap them in meaningful business exceptions.
- **Global Exception Handling:** Use `@ControllerAdvice` or `@RestControllerAdvice` to handle exceptions across the application, mapping them to appropriate HTTP responses.

By following these practices, you'll have a clear and consistent approach to where exceptions should be thrown or caught in your REST service.
